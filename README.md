# Malware Extractor

Extract IOCs from malware samples to help in the static analysis during incident response. It can be used to scan entire hosts in search of compromised files or to extract data from single binary files.

Formats supported are PE, ELF, DEX and MACH-O. It can be extended by just adding a parser of the file type needed.


## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/malwarai/malware-extractor.git

cd malware-extractor

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Running the program

To see all available commands 

```
python main.py -h

```

To extract static data from a binary just use the -fe argument

```
python main.py -fe file_to_extract_data_from.exe
```

To scan a file to determine if it may be malicious, you can can pass the following arguments: -fs (file to be scanned) and -yr (the yara compiled file to match against)

```
python main.py -fs file_to_be_analyzed.exe -yr compiled_yara_file.yara
```
For scanning an entire directory or host provide -rd (root directory) from where to start the scan.

```
python main.py -rd /directory_to_be_scanned/ -yr compiled_yara_file.yara
```

The output of the scans and analysis will be saved in a txt file in the same directory.
